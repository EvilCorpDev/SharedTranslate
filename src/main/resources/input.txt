Africa: At the time Machiavelli is writing about on page 18,
‘Africa’ named a coastal strip of north Africa, including some
of what are now Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya. The site of city
Carthage is now the site of a suburb of Tunis.
element: On page 5 Machiavelli speaks of ‘the more weak’
and ‘the more strong’, with no noun. He could be talking
about (i) weaker and stronger individuals or factions within
the acquired state, or (ii) weaker and stronger substates or
provinces of which the newly acquired state is made up. The
rest of that chapter hooks into (ii); but page 5 also makes
Machiavellian sense when taken in the manner of (i); perhaps
he meant to be talking about both at once.
fortuna: This word occurs nearly 60 times in the work.
Most occurrences of it could be translated by ‘luck’, but
for Machiavelli its meaning is clearly broader than that—
something more like ‘circumstances beyond one’s control’.
The interplay between this and virtù is a dominant theme
in The Prince. [For a superb discussion of this theme, see J. G. A.
Pocock’s The Machiavellian Moment (Princeton University Press, 2003),
chapter 6.] So fortuna is left untranslated except where
Machiavelli writes of someone’s privata fortuna, meaning
his status or condition as an ordinary citizen (rather than
someone with rank and power). The five occurrences of this
are all translated by ‘ordinary citizen’. Italian lets us choose
between ‘it’ and ‘she’ for fortuna, but nothing in this work
invites us to personalize it except the striking last paragraph
on page 53.
